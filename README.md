# Web Application for Coding Skill Enhancement | Code Junior

**Description:** A gamified web application designed to help users practice and enhance their coding skills through interactive challenges. This project was developed during my first year at university and focuses on making coding practice more engaging and fun by turning it into a game.

**Key Features:**
- User System: Register, log in, and log out functionality  
- Game System: Random question generation, instant answer submission, and immediate feedback  
- Scoreboard: Real-time score updates  
- Duplicate Prevention: Blacklist system to prevent repeating questions in the same session

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (AJAX used for asynchronous communication)  
- Backend: Spring Boot (developed RESTful APIs for data handling and answer processing)  
- Database: MySQL (stores user information, scores, and question bank)

**System Architecture & Design:**
- Designed using OOP principles, flowcharts, and class diagrams  
- Implemented RESTful APIs to handle communication between frontend and backend  
- Game mechanics and control systems were carefully designed to ensure a smooth user experience

**How it works:**
- JavaScript fetches random coding questions via RESTful API without reloading the page (AJAX)  
- Users submit their answers, which are processed by Spring Boot backend  
- The system provides instant feedback, updates the score, and stores it in MySQL database  
- Users can continue their session even after closing the browser
